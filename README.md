# Basic-Calculator
This is a basic calculator which is built using the Java programming language on the IntelliJ IDEA compiler. 
It contains basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus of two numbers.
The code is written using the Scanner class which takes the input from the user and gives the result based on the input given by the user by using the mentioned operations.
Switch case is used with all the operations including the default case also which will be executed when the user didn't enter any operation.
All the code starting from scanner class till default case is enclosed in while loop with the infinite condition of true so that if the user performs a calculation and he wants to do the calculation again he can simply write "y" for yes and "n" for no according to his choice.
Along with it a thread sleep function is also used using try catch block so that when the user hits "n" it will take 3 seconds to close the calculator and message of thank you will be displayed after the exit.
The user has to simply click run button and enter the values and the operation to see the result and "n" for exiting the calculator.
